I’m a cybersecurity enthusiast with a strong focus on offensive security, penetration testing, and CTF-style learning. I spend most of my time breaking down real-world attack paths, exploiting vulnerable systems, and understanding why security controls fail and how to bypass them. I worked as a software engineer for three years, and I’m currently pursuing a Master’s in Cybersecurity (InfoSec track) at Georgia Tech, with academic interests in malware analysis and secure system design.

I’m an active Hack The Box CTF player, where I train across web exploitation, Active Directory attacks, reverse engineering, and network security. I approach challenges as realistic adversary simulations, emphasizing enumeration, chaining misconfigurations, privilege escalation, pillaging, pivoting, and persistence.

To continually refine my methodology and stay current with modern attack techniques, I use Hack The Box Academy as a structured learning environment. I work through Academy paths to strengthen fundamentals, pressure-test my assumptions, and incorporate emerging vulnerabilities and tradecraft into my workflow. This hands-on approach helps me stay up to date with real-world exploitation patterns rather than relying solely on static theory or checklists. Through this process, I’ve earned the CPTS and CWES certifications as milestones of applied learning rather than endpoints. I also participate in HTB's seasonal competitive mode alongside my team BotnetBuddies, where we chain cutting-edge CVEs and exploits to root new boxes weekly.

This blog is a place to document CTF write-ups, attack methodologies, and security concepts I’m actively learning.
